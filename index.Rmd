Hello, Website!

For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html.

Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are _not_ based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
meta_files <- list.files("meta", "[.]json$", full.names = TRUE)
htmltools::tags$ul(
  lapply(meta_files, function(json_file) {
    json <- jsonlite::read_json(json_file)
    href <- sub(".json$", ".html", basename(json_file))
    with(json, {
      htmltools::tags$li(
        htmltools::a(href = href, title),
        "by", author, 
        htmltools::a(href = url, target = "_blank", "[source]")
      )
    })
  })
)
```
